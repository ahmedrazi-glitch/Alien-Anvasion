JS Project Proposal: Alien Anvasion
Background
Alien Anvasion is a classic single user interactive game. The original game plays out on a rectangular grid. The flying saucer has appeared from space and is in search of some samples to take back to the mothership. As the game begins the flying saucer will hover over some land mass and the user (Alien) will have to click to pick some things from the field for experimentation. The user (Alien) can pick humans, sheeps, cows, chickens etc from the field. As the levels increase in the game, so does the difficulty. Over the next iterations of the game, the game will include:
1) Many different objects to be taken by the saucer. Including an entire car, truck or even a building. 
* In the next iteration of the game, the flying saucer will be driven by the user over different places.
There are many existing versions of this game. This simulation will incorporate several of those variations, outlined in the Functionality & MVP and Bonus Features sections.
Functionality & MVPs
With this Alien Anvasion Game, users will be able to:
Start, pause, and reset the game.
Pick samples from the ground against gravity.
Win a game and move to the next level of difficulty.


In addition, this project will include:
An About modal describing the background and rules of the game
A production README
Wireframe







Nav links include links to this project's Github repo, my LinkedIn and AngelList, and the About modal.
Game controls will include Start, Stop, and Reset buttons.
On the right, there will be a clickable button used to toggle between sound on/off.
At the top there is the name of the game with a theme.
Additionally, an instructions button will be added to the right side of the bar to help the user. Along with some other info about the game.
Technologies, Libraries, APIs
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
The Canvas API to render the game board
Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
npm to manage project dependencies
Implementation Timeline
NB:
Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Get canvas to show up on the screen, and spend time getting comfortable with the Canvas API. Create Board and Cell classes. Get a grid rendered to the canvas reflecting the initial state of the cells.
Monday: Dedicate this day toward implementing the underlying logic of Conway's Game of Life. Ensure that I can advance a generation and all the cells update appropriately. If time, make sure this is all rendered correctly on the canvas.
Tuesday: If I didn't get to it already, get the cells correctly rendered to the canvas. Make sure they rerender correctly when I advance a generation. Then, focus on user controls: start, stop, reset, and clicking on cells.
Wednesday: Finish implementing user controls, and focus on styling, as well as implementing the different color schemes and nav links. If time, start on bonuses.
Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.
